# Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) Analysis

Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) is a powerful tool used in bioinformatics for analyzing multiple aligned DNA sequences. This README provides a step-by-step guide on how to use PSSM for analyzing aligned DNA sequences.

## Step 1: Input Methods

Choose between two input methods:

a. Read prepared multiple aligned DNA sequences from a file called "PSSMData.txt", where the first line contains values for t sequences and n nucleotides.

b. Generate t sequences where one sequence of length n is formed of a random order of nucleotides.

## Step 2: Print Multiple Aligned DNA Sequences

Display the multiple aligned DNA sequences to the user after reading from the file or generating randomly.

## Step 3: Apply PSSM

Implement the PSSM algorithm to analyze the multiple aligned DNA sequences. Construct the PSSM matrix by applying three steps:

1. Count Frequencies according to each position.
2. Normalize Frequencies by dividing them by the overall frequency.
3. Convert the values to the prob values by calculating the logarithm base of 2.

## Step 4: Print PSSM Matrix

Display the constructed PSSM matrix to the user for analysis.

## Step 5: Probability Calculation

Prompt the user to enter a new sequence of length n. Calculate the probability of the new entered sequence joining the rest of the multiple aligned DNA sequences based on the PSSM matrix.

Follow these steps to effectively utilize the PSSM algorithm for analyzing multiple aligned DNA sequences. PSSM provides valuable insights into sequence conservation, functional elements, and sequence evolution, aiding in various bioinformatics applications.
